                <p>I am a dedicated B.Tech student pursuing my studies at GITA Autonomous College in Bhubaneswar. With a
                    passion for technology, I specialize in Computer Science and Engineering, and I am currently gaining
                    invaluable experience as a Web Developer intern at Gauravgo Technologies. Beyond coding, I find joy
                    in the realm of competitive coding, constantly challenging myself to enhance my problem-solving
                    skills. My fascination with technology doesn't end there; I'm also an avid learner and a tech
                    enthusiast, always eager to embrace new skills and technologies. Aside from my technical pursuits, I
                    have a flair for writing and love to express myself through words. My journey is marked by a fervent
                    desire to explore the ever-evolving landscape of technology while fostering creativity and
